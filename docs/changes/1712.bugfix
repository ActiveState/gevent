Make `gevent.pywsgi` trying to enforce the rules for reading chunked input or
``Content-Length`` terminated input when the connection is being
upgraded, for example to a websocket connection. Likewise, if the
protocol was switched by returning a ``101`` status, stop trying to
automatically chunk the responses.
