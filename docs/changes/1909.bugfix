Update to greenlet 2.0. This fixes a deallocation issue that required
a change in greenlet's ABI. The design of greenlet 2.0 is intended to
prevent future fixes and enhancements from requiring an ABI change,
making it easier to update gevent and greenlet independently.

.. caution::

   greenlet 2.0 requires a modern-ish C++ compiler. This may mean
   certain older platforms are no longer supported.
