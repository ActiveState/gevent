Improve the ability to use monkey-patched locks, and
`gevent.lock.BoundedSemaphore`, across threads, especially when the
various threads might not have a gevent hub or any other active
greenlets. In particular, this handles some cases that previously
raised ``LoopExit`` or would hang.

The semaphore tries to avoid creating a hub if it seems unnecessary,
automatically creating one in the single-threaded case when it would
block, but not in the multi-threaded case. While the differences
should be correctly detected, it's possible there are corner cases
where they might not be.

If your application appears to hang acquiring semaphores, but adding a
call to ``gevent.get_hub()`` in the thread attempting to acquire the
semaphore before doing so fixes it, please file an issue.
