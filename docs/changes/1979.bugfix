Make ``gevent.select.select`` accept arbitrary iterables, not just
sequences. That is, you can now pass in a generator of file
descriptors instead of a realized list. Internally, arbitrary
iterables are copied into lists. This better matches what the standard
library does. Thanks to David Salvisberg.
