Make gevent ``FileObjects`` more closely match the semantics of native
file objects for the ``name`` attribute:

- Objects opened from a file descriptor integer have that integer as
  their ``name.`` (Note that this is the Python 3 semantics; Python 2
  native file objects returned from ``os.fdopen()`` have the string
  "<fdopen>" as their name , but here gevent always follows Python 3.)
- The ``name`` remains accessible after the file object is closed.

Thanks to Dan Milon.
