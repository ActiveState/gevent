Python 2: Make ``gevent.subprocess.Popen.stdin`` objects have a
``write`` method that guarantees to write the entire argument in
binary, unbuffered mode. This may require multiple trips around the
event loop, but more closely matches the behaviour of the Python 2
standard library (and gevent prior to 1.5). The number of bytes
written is still returned (instead of ``None``).
