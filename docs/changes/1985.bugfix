On Python 3.11 and newer, opt out of Cython's fast exception
manipulation, which *may* be causing problems in certain circumstances
when combined with greenlets.

On all versions of Python, adjust some error handling in the default
C-based loop. This fixes several assertion failures on debug versions
of CPython. Hopefully it has a positive impact under real conditions.
